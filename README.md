#  CareKit on WatchOS

Apple Watch is so much present in out life nowadays, so we thing that bring the CareKit UI to WatchOS is a very important step to do. Having the ability to quickly log an illness
(like nausea or dizziness) in a way that does not require to access to a device that is not at your wrist can be quite difficult when feeling sick. 

We believe that health-tracking should be as easy as possible. With this in mind, we're building library containing CareKitUI elements for Apple Watch. The final result will contain task and contact cards, and other CareKitUI elements adapted for the Watch.


## Getting started

**WARNING**: This library is a work in progress. Currently the components are not engineered to be used in production apps.


You may see the catalogue of the availbale cards in the Example project. Open the project and build it on Apple Watch in simulator or on device.

To get started with the library, clone this repository on you Mac and open with Xcode. 
Then, manually import the product inside your WatchOS Xcode project.
