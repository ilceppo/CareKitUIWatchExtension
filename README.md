#  CareKit on WatchOS

Apple Watch is so much present in out life nowadays, so we thing that bring the CareKit UI to WatchOS is a very important step to do. Having the ability to quickly log an illness
(like nausea or dizziness) in a way that does not require to access to a device that is not at your wrist can be quite difficult when feeling sick. 

We believe that health-tracking should be as easy as possible. With this in mind, we're building library containing CareKitUI elements for Apple Watch. The final result will contain task and contact cards, and other CareKitUI elements adapted for the Watch.
